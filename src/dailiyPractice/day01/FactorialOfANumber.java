/*Write a Java program to calculate the factorial of a given number using a for loop.
For example, if the input is 5, the program should output 120 (because5!=5×4×3×2×1).

Steps to Solve:

Ask the user to input a number N.
Initialize a variable factorial to 1.
Use a for loop to multiply factorial by each number from 1 to N.
Print the result.*/
